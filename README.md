# Autocorrect-Python
# Description-
Let’s say you typed a word in your keyboard if the word will exist in the vocabulary of our smartphone then it will assume that you have written the right word. Now it doesn’t matter whether you write a name, a noun or any word on the planet.
If the word exists in the history of the smartphone, it will generalize the word as a correct word. What if the word doesn’t exist? If the word that you typed is a non-existing word in the history of our smartphone then the autocorrect is programmed to find the most similar words in the history of our smartphone.
